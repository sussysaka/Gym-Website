<h1>Aadyant Body bulding GYM</h1>
<p>
A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is a covered location for athletics. 
The word is derived from the ancient Greek gymnasium.[1] They are commonly found in athletic and 
fitness centres, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang 
for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or 
describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" (or pl: gymnasia") 
often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing 
or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do 
exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a
secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university,
with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment
